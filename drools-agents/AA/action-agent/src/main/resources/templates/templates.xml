            <![CDATA[
            ER and PR should be measured in all patients with breast cancer. The primary purpose of measuring these receptors is to identify patients with breast cancer that can be treated with hormone therapy. In combination with established prognostic factors (i.e., tumor stage, tumor grade, and number of lymph node metastases), ER and PR may also be used for determining short-term prognosis in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer.<br>Please indicate whether you accept this recommendation using the choices offered below. If you accept, an appropriate order will be filed electroinically on your behalf. If you would like to change the order for any reason, please select 'Modify' to edit as appropriate.
